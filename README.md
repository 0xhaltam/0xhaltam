# About me

&emsp;Graduated in IT, I've been working for over six years as a developer where I've been working as a fullstack, with a preference in the backend and a lot of experience in integration with payment systems and fintechs. I'm passionate about retro and low-level computing. I really enjoy creating hack roms on NES, SNES and Gameboy (all of them). I'm currently in my second college, computer engineering. I really like the open-source universe and everything that surrounds it. Linux fanboy! Doomaniac!

## Software Development

&emsp;I had contact with computers from an early age and I always spent hours and hours in front of them. Where I had the opportunity to learn several things from creating games, going through the development of my own rpgs, to learning 3D in a self-taught way that allowed me to start as a freelancer and later open my first company, where I worked with virtualization of environments and renderings for interior design. What always made me happy with 3D was the freedom to be able to work with programming to write shaders and all the math involved in the process. I am extremely passionate about the history of computing and everything that involves computers. Due to my ease with numbers since my first experience in a bank, I have always continued working in the financial area, where I somehow consider myself an enthusiast in relation to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I have extensive experience in creating, integrating and maintaining payment and finance software.
