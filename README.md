## Software Development

&emsp;I had contact with computers from an early age and I always spent hours and hours in front of them. Where I had the opportunity to learn several things from creating games, going through the development of my own rpgs, to learning 3D in a self-taught way that allowed me to start as a freelancer and later open my first company, where I worked with virtualization of environments and renderings for interior design. What always made me happy with 3D was the freedom to be able to work with programming to write shaders and all the math involved in the process. I am extremely passionate about the history of computing and everything that involves computers. Due to my ease with numbers since my first experience in a bank, I have always continued working in the financial area, where I somehow consider myself an enthusiast in relation to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I have extensive experience in creating, integrating and maintaining payment and finance software.

## Physics and Mathematics

&emsp;Since my adolescence I have always loved physics and with my brother graduating in the field, it created more motivation for me to start my bachelor's degree in physics and the passion for understanding numbers motivated me to start my bachelor's degree in mathematics. Within physics I am extremely fascinated by the quantum universe and everything that surrounds it, considering myself a student and enthusiast in quantum physics. In the field of mathematics, geometry and the study of prime numbers has become a great passion, in which I have aspirations of writing some things about in a possible master's degree in the future. My main objective currently is to join IMPA (Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics) in Rio de Janeiro to start my studies in the areas that fascinate me so much.
