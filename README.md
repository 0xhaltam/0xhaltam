&emsp;Graduated in IT, I have been working for over eight years as a developer, primarily focusing on backend and DevOps. During this time, I have specialized in the maintenance, documentation, and development of legacy software using C# and Java. I have extensive experience integrating with payment systems and fintechs. I'm passionate about retro and low-level computing and enjoy creating hack ROMs for NES, SNES, and Gameboy. Currently, I am pursuing my second degree in computer engineering. I am a Linux enthusiast and a Doomaniac!

## Software Development

&emsp;I had contact with computers from an early age and always spent hours and hours in front of them. This early exposure allowed me to develop a deep understanding of various technologies and systems. Over the years, I have honed my skills in backend development, focusing on C# and Java, and have gained extensive experience in DevOps practices. I am proficient in managing queues, working with AWS, designing architectures, and implementing RESTful, SOAP, and gRPC services. 

&emsp;My experience also includes using Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, conducting comprehensive testing, and utilizing Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. As a Linux enthusiast, I have a deep understanding of system administration, scripting, and leveraging command-line tools to streamline workflows. Additionally, I prioritize security in all aspects of development, ensuring robust and secure solutions for the financial and fintech sectors.

&emsp;Due to my ease with numbers since my first experience in a bank, I have always continued working in the financial area, where I consider myself an enthusiast in relation to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I have extensive experience in creating, integrating, and maintaining payment and finance software.
